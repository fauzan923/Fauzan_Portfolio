In this project, we're doing a research on comparison between the performance of hybrid machine learning LightGBM + XGBoost + Logistic Regression and individual machine learning LightGBM in detecting malware with a Portable Executable Format, and make an application based on the research results. And the results is hybrid machine learning performance is better than individual machine learning, so in this project we're gonna make a malware detection application based on hybrid machine learning.
